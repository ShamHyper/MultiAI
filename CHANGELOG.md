- New lines for debug (config.json)

## 1.6.x
- New AI - **Video Analyzer**. Analyze Video like in **Image Analyzer**, but analyze per-frame of video and give you avg. percentages specs. of them
- Fixes for debug launch-timer
- Removed IceCream logging for GitHub. Now this only dev-version function
- Better model loading
- Better console outputs
- "preload_models" option in config.json
- Added batch for **Video Analyzer**

## 1.5.x
- *New* system of loading models (35s preloading, but faster working)
- Code optimization
- Fixed lying debug timer
- Debug-timer optimizations
## 1.4.x
- Deleted preload models because this function is corrupted and unuseful
- Added checkbox in **Prompt Generator** - randomize temperature of prompt. Temperature controls the level of "creativity" of the AI on a scale from 0 to 1, the default value is 0.7. The lower, the more impersonal the text will be. The higher â€” the more unusual the text will be. I set the value from 0.4 to 0.9 when enabling the "randomizer". This will help to avoid duplicate prompts when generating with the same text.

- Added emojis for buttons to better understand the interface
